# Project Charter: SDLC Modernization

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Terragon-Optimized SDLC Implementation  
**Start Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Expected Completion**: Q2 2026  
**Project Sponsor**: Daniel Schmidt  
**Project Manager**: Terragon Team  

## Problem Statement

Daniel Schmidt's portfolio repository showcases impressive technical expertise but lacks the comprehensive SDLC practices expected in enterprise environments. The current state includes basic project structure but missing critical elements like automated testing, security scanning, comprehensive documentation, and modern DevOps practices.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Foundation**: Complete project documentation and architecture design
- **Development Environment**: Standardized tooling and development workflows
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing strategy with automation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes
- **Security Integration**: Security scanning, SBOM generation, and compliance
- **Monitoring**: Observability, metrics collection, and alerting
- **Documentation**: User guides, API docs, and operational runbooks

### Out of Scope
- Migration of existing projects (focus on infrastructure and processes)
- Custom application development beyond SDLC tooling
- Third-party service integrations beyond standard DevOps tools
- Proprietary or commercial tool implementations

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Complete SDLC Implementation**: All 8 checkpoints successfully deployed
2. **Automated Quality Gates**: 100% automated testing and security scanning
3. **Documentation Completeness**: Comprehensive docs for all processes and systems
4. **Security Compliance**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities in production
5. **Operational Excellence**: <1 hour MTTR, >99% uptime

### Secondary Success Criteria
1. **Developer Experience**: Streamlined onboarding and development workflows
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete documentation enabling team scalability
3. **Future-Proofing**: Extensible architecture for additional projects
4. **Industry Standards**: Alignment with SLSA, DORA, and security best practices

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- **Technical Lead**: 1 FTE for architecture and complex implementations
- **DevOps Engineer**: 0.5 FTE for CI/CD and infrastructure
- **Technical Writer**: 0.25 FTE for documentation
- **Security Consultant**: 0.25 FTE for security implementation

### Technical Resources
- GitHub repository and Actions (existing)
- Container registry access
- Security scanning tools (free tier)
- Monitoring tools (open source)

### Budget Considerations
- No significant financial investment required
- Leveraging free/open source tools
- Primary cost is time investment

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **GitHub Permissions Limitations**
   - *Impact*: Cannot create workflows directly
   - *Mitigation*: Provide templates and documentation for manual setup

2. **Complexity Overengineering**
   - *Impact*: Extended timeline and maintenance burden
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on MVP implementations with clear ROI

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Tool Integration Challenges**
   - *Impact*: Delayed implementation of specific features
   - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing and fallback options

2. **Documentation Drift**
   - *Impact*: Outdated documentation reducing project value
   - *Mitigation*: Automated documentation generation where possible

## Communication Plan

### Regular Communications
- **Daily Standup**: Progress updates and blocker identification
- **Weekly Review**: Milestone progress and stakeholder updates
- **Checkpoint Demos**: Demonstration of completed checkpoint functionality

### Escalation Process
1. **Technical Issues**: Technical Lead → Project Sponsor
2. **Timeline Risks**: Project Manager → Project Sponsor  
3. **Scope Changes**: All stakeholders consultation required

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- 90%+ test coverage for all new code
- Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive documentation for all public interfaces
- Adherence to established coding standards

### Review Processes
- All changes require peer review
- Security review for security-related changes
- Architecture review for structural changes
- Documentation review for all user-facing content

## Project Governance

### Decision Making
- **Technical Decisions**: Technical Lead with team input
- **Scope Changes**: Project Sponsor approval required
- **Timeline Adjustments**: Project Manager with stakeholder consultation

### Change Control
- All scope changes documented and approved
- Impact assessment required for significant changes
- Version control for all project artifacts
