# GitHub Workflows Templates

⚠️ **Note**: These workflow files need to be manually copied to `.github/workflows/` directory due to GitHub App permission restrictions.

## Available Workflows

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
- Comprehensive quality gates with parallel execution
- Security scanning (Trivy, Bandit, Safety)
- Multi-language testing (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript)
- Container building and signing with Cosign
- SBOM generation for supply chain security
- Performance benchmarking
- Automated deployment to staging/production

### 2. Autonomous Backlog Management (`backlog-automation.yml`)
- Daily TODO/FIXME discovery from codebase
- Automatic backlog validation and metrics generation
- GitHub Issues synchronization
- Dashboard updates and health monitoring
- Backlog analytics and reporting

## Manual Setup Instructions

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository root
2. Copy the workflow files from this directory to `.github/workflows/`
3. Commit and push the workflows
4. Configure required secrets in GitHub repository settings:
   - `FOSSA_API_KEY` (if using FOSSA for license scanning)
   - Any deployment-specific secrets

## Workflow Features

### Security-First Approach
- Zero-tolerance for critical security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive dependency scanning
- Secret detection and validation
- Container security with CIS benchmarks

### Quality Assurance
- 85%+ test coverage requirements
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Performance benchmarking with trend analysis
- Documentation completeness validation

### Automation Capabilities
- Self-healing pipeline recovery
- Intelligent retry mechanisms
- Automatic backlog prioritization
- Real-time metrics collection

### Integration Support
- Slack/Teams notifications
- JIRA/Linear project management sync
- Prometheus metrics export
- Custom webhook integrations

## Configuration

Each workflow supports extensive configuration through:
- Environment variables
- Workflow inputs
- Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
- Runtime parameters

Refer to the individual workflow files for specific configuration options and customization possibilities.

## Troubleshooting

If workflows fail:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Verify all required secrets are configured
3. Ensure proper repository permissions
4. Review branch protection rules
5. Validate workflow syntax with GitHub's workflow validator
