# Autonomous Backlog Management System

An intelligent backlog management system that uses WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) scoring to automatically discover, prioritize, and execute development tasks.

## Overview

This system implements autonomous backlog management based on Lean-Agile principles:

- **Continuous Discovery**: Automatically finds TODO/FIXME comments, failing tests, and technical debt
- **WSJF Prioritization**: Scores items using Cost of Delay (Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Effort
- **Automated Execution**: Follows TDD principles with security-first development
- **Metrics & Reporting**: Tracks progress and generates status reports

## Key Features

- 🔍 **Smart Discovery**: Scans codebase for actionable items
- 📊 **Data-Driven Prioritization**: Uses proven WSJF methodology
- 🛡️ **Security by Design**: Built-in security validation and safe practices
- 🧪 **Test-Driven Development**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- 📈 **Progress Tracking**: Automated metrics and reporting

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd autonomous-backlog-management
```

### Usage

1. **View Current Backlog**: Check `backlog.yml` for prioritized items
2. **Add New Items**: Follow the format in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
3. **Check Progress**: Review reports in `docs/status/`

### Development Workflow

1. Items flow through: `NEW → REFINED → READY → DOING → PR → DONE`
2. All changes follow TDD: Write failing test → Make it pass → Refactor
3. Security validation required for all inputs and outputs
4. CI gates ensure code quality before merge

## WSJF Scoring

Items are prioritized using the Weighted Shortest Job First formula:

```
WSJF Score = (Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Effort
```

All dimensions use Fibonacci scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
